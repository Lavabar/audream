C5. Imagine that while travelling during your holidays you took some photos. Choose one photo to present to your friend. You will have to start speaking in 1,5 minutes and will speak for not more than 2 minutes.
In your talk remember to speak about:
-when you took the picture
-who/what is in the photo 
-what is happening
-why you took this photo
-why you decided to show it to your friend

You have to talk continuously, starting with:
